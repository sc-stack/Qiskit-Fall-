# Qiskit-Fall-
ReadME for fall Qiskit
In this project we utilzied Qiskit to implement the probabilities for a quantum roulette game. 

For our quantum register we utilized 2 qubits and each with a Hatermark gate to put them in superposition. Hence, they can be in both states simulateously. Hence, if a roultette was to be spinned the probabilites would be synonymous. 

We utilized a CNOT gate in order to create the MOE since with the Hatermark gates we had equal probabilites. 

The MOE (Margin of Error) evolves around the less than 1% chance of error that is generated by the quantum computing due to inteference and entanglement. We are using this for the third (and very low) possiblity that most roulette games have.
